# Initiative-Tracker
An android application for use with tabletop RPG games to help DMs with tracking stats for PC and NPC characters, as well as handy content generators
For now the project consists only of the initiative tracker and is based on the DnD 5e rules for initiative.

### Features (so far)

- Add PC and NPC characters with their names and initiative modifiers and roll separate initiative orders for each round of combat
- Add a bunch of monsters with pregenerated numbered names with one tap
- Remove characters from combat as they leave or die

### Installation Guide

You can download the .apk file I provide when major content updates come in, or you can clone the whole project and use Android Studio or any other tool to make your own .apk files.


This is a project I work on for fun and is a work in progress!
