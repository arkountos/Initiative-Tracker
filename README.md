# Orcs Attack!
An android application for use with tabletop RPG games to help DMs with tracking stats for PC and NPC characters, as well as handy content generators.
For now the project consists only of the initiative tracker and is based on the DnD 5e rules for initiative.

### Features (so far)

- Add PC and NPC characters with their names and initiative modifiers and roll separate initiative orders for each round of combat
- Add a bunch of monsters with pregenerated numbered names with one tap
- Remove characters from combat as they leave or die
- Random Encounter Wilderness Map generator, with customizable options for tree and river spawns, as well as a campfire indicating the player's camp position
- Include the starting positions of allies and enemies on the map to achieve complete DM impartiallity ;)
- Add a camp and have the friendly characters spawn near it while the enemies creep from all around it

### Installation Guide

Hopefully you can get the app on Google's Playstore! 

This is a project I work on for fun and is a work in progress!
